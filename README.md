# elevators
elevator script for fivem

I wanted to make something to utilize elevators that have open interiors without going into additional UIs for the clients while still making it relatively easy to expand as elevators were added to the city.

As such this script uses the following dependencies, however these can easily be changed on the client side.
nh-context
nh-keyboard
qtarget

I have provided a few preset elevators to utilize as examples and have heavily commented on how to add additional elevators.
